# Sublime Text 2 CSV Plugin

A plugin to manage CSV files. Currently supports sorting and exporting of the data.

## Install

The preferred method is to use the [Sublime Package Manager](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). Alternatively, the files can be obtained on github:

    $ https://github.com/ericmartel/Sublime-Text-2-CSV-Plugin

## Format

The way to format the data is to index each column using {#}, so for a 3 column data set where you want to only keep the first and last column, the Format string would be something similar to

    $ {0}, {2}

## Complete Documentation

A website is currently under construction to explain the usage of the plugin in details.
